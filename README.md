# [AIR] TIME
Your tool to keeping track of time during live presentations or other events.

## About the tool
[AIR] TIME is a simple tool for keeping track during presentations, talks or any other events. It features a big red timer (or stopwatch) showing either how much is left of your limit or what duration has passed. If the timer reaches it limit, an overtime counter appears. This one can be distinguished at a glance by the pulsating red background and the flashing "+" letting you know you should finish shortly.

It feels more professional and works better than setting a simple timer. At the end, [AIR] TIME tells you how long it took and if you went over the set limit.

The website is also available as a **progressive web app** (specifically for iOS).
